# o4spa
O4SPA is order 4 point side-channel attack on elliptic curve. 
This attack exploit the weakness of Curve25519 on the scalar multiplication algorithm and its implementation with Montgomery ladder.
This python code is a machine learning algorithm for pattern recognition. It is meant to train a model from SCA traces (trainingset.csv) and analyse other similar attacks (testset.csv).
The device used for the attack is ArduinoUNO and traces are power consumption of the microcontroler.
